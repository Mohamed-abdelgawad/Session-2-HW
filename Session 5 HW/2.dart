// Exercise 2: Variables and Data Types
// Declare three variables:
// - An integer named age with a value of 25.
// - A double named height with a value of 5.9.
// - A string named name with a value of "Dart Programmer".
// Print each variable's value.
// Goal: Understand variable declaration and Dart's type system.

void main(List<String> args) {
  int age = 25;
  double height = 5.9;
  String name = 'Dart Programmer';

  print('A $name with height $height and his age is $age');
}
